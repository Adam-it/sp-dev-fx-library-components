# SharePoint Framework Library Component Samples & Tutorial Materials

This repository contains the samples that demonstrate different usage patterns for the SharePoint Framework library component.

SharePoint Framework library components are shared code, which multiple SharePoint Framework can easily share in the context of the SharePoint or Microsoft TEams. You can build library components using modern script development tools and you can deploy your library components in Office 365 tenants. In addition to plain JavaScript projects, you can also build library components with common scripting frameworks, such as AngularJS and React.
